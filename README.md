#Warmup - CSS Frameworks - Bootstrap Mockup

##Warmup Objective
Create a responsive mini-site using a CSS framework. Make sure that the icons are aligning in 
- 1 column on small screens 
- 2 columns on medium screens 
- 4 columns on desktop screens

I have already included a link to the icon fonts, but **you must link to the CSS framework's `.css` file in the `</head>`**
