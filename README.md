#Warmup - CSS Frameworks - Bootstrap Mockup

##Warmup Objective
Create a responsive mini-site using a css framework. Make sure that the icons are aligning in 1 column on small screens, 2 columns on medium screens, and 4 columns on desktop screens.

I have already included a link to the icon fonts, but **you must link to the css framework's `.css` file in the `</head>`**
